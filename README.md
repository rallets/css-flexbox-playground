Css Flexbox playground

Based on the [Pluralsight course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/css-flexbox-creating-responsive-pages/) "Creating Responsive Pages with CSS FlexBox" by Jeff Batt.

*Flexboxes make creating web page layouts quicker, easier, and offer greater flexibility than rows and columns. This course will teach you how to get started with Flexboxes using nothing but CSS.*
